It's been a loooong time since I've done anything web-related...I'm not even sure jQuery existed the last time I made a website. Please do forgive me if I've broken a few dozen web coding conventions.

Note : Works on Chrome v33. Works on Firefox v28, but compiling the shaders causes Firefox to freeze for almost a minute (I think Firefox has a problem with loop unrolling, but that's just a guess...). Can't get it to work on IE 11 yet. Not tested on other browsers.
